# Running a mini chaos event

As an alternative to running a full chaos day, we found benefit at one client condensing the entire process into 2.5 hours.&#x20;

| <p>In a recent engagement, time was limited to spend on proactive failure investigations. The digital platform team took on the role of facilitators for 9 delivery teams to introduce chaos engineering principles and help increase the understanding of the digital services they were building and operating. With limitations on time for the exercises across all the teams, instead of running full chaos days with multiple ongoing scenarios, we ran 2.5-hour sessions that included two experiments and a post-incident review.</p><p></p><p>To choose experiments under those conditions, we ran experiment selection sessions with the team leads to select potential failures to investigate and gather knowledge on based on two factors:</p><ul><li>the level of impact a potential failure might have upon the user, team, or organisation</li><li>whether the response to that potential failure was known or unknown either by the service, team, or other parts of the organisation</li></ul><p></p><p>Prioritising together with the team leads, we selected experiments that allowed the team to investigate potential failures with a high level of impact with an unknown response, under the belief that it would provide the best conditions for the team to understand more about how their service worked.</p><p></p><p>A team had built an authenticated user journey to manage personal details and payment methods. During an experiment selection exercise, we found a great example of a high impact/unknown response failure where if a request failed to be sent to the authentication provider it could prevent users from being able to login in.</p><p></p><p>The potential failure had a high impact on the user experience and the team was unsure of the response with the authentication provider hosting the login pages, it was unclear if any alerts would be fired and if theyâ€™d be notified. </p> |
